# Blender User Interface Simplified

This addon is to help new users of blender to get use to some of its interface. Since the user interface of Blender can be a bit overwhelming to beginners
I thought I would make an addon to help new users. In this addon I added some key things such as adding objects to the viewport which can be foun under the add an
object panel, I have added a modifications panel which allows you to add modifiers quickly to your objects and I have also added a settings panel in which you will 
be allowed to report a bug or a request. I just want to take a moment to say that this is my 1st addon that I have created for blender so please don't judge too harshly.

# Installing the addon

You will need Blender 2.80 or higher to install this addon. You do not
need to extract the zip file when you download this addon. Once you have
installed Blender go to edit > user preference > addons > then hit the install
button. The addon will appear in the user interface in Blender.
